# Splunk OpenTelemetry iOS agent Crash Reporting module

This is an addon to the [Splunk RUM iOS agent](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-ios)
that adds crash reporting via [PLCrashReporter](https://github.com/microsoft/plcrashreporter).

> :construction: This project is currently in **BETA**. It is **officially supported** by Splunk. However, breaking changes **MAY** be introduced.

## Getting Started

To get started, first follow the instructions to add the SplunkOtel package
to your application, then import this optional crash reporting package into your app, 
either through the Xcode menu
`File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency` or through your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-ios/", from: "0.4.0");
.package(url: "https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-ios-crashreporting/", from: "0.4.0");
...
.target(name: "MyAwesomeApp", dependencies: ["SplunkOtel", "SplunkOtelCrashReporting]),
```

You'll then need to start the crash reporting **after** initializing the 
SplunkRum library:


```swift
import SplunkOtel
import SplunkOtelCrashReporting
...
// Your beaconUrl and rumAuth will be provided by your friendly Splunk representative
SplunkRum.initialize(beaconUrl: "https://rum-ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v1/rum", rumAuth: "ABCD...")
SplunkRumCrashReporting.start()
```

or

```objectivec
@import SplunkOtel;
@import SplunkOtelCrashReporting;
...
// Your beaconUrl and rumAuth will be provided by your friendly Splunk representative
[SplunkRum initializeWithBeaconUrl: @"https://rum-ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v1/rum" rumAuth: @"ABCD..." options: nil];
[SplunkRumCrashReporting start]
```
